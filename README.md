# Mystical Prophecy Generator

A whimsical Node.js application that generates mysterious and poetic prophecies by combining random elements of time, place, action, and prophetic conclusions.

## Description

This program is a creative text generator that creates ethereal prophecies by combining elements from four carefully curated lists:
- Mystical times (e.g., "moonless night", "whispered hour")
- Enigmatic places (e.g., "shifting light", "ancient echoes")
- Prophetic actions (e.g., "walk a path unseen by others")
- Profound conclusions (e.g., "The stars have spoken")

Each generated prophecy follows the format:
> "On a [time] in a place of [place] you will [action]. [conclusion]"
